# Introduction

  

This project is to test a Tic Tac Toe app. The tests included in the project are UI integration tests.

  

# Contribute

### Elements.js:
This file is intended to be a place to put all selectors. This allows small updates to be made in one place versus across the entire repository if needed.

- Try to never put validation in this file, all validation should still live at the test level
- Give the elements alias in case they are used multiple times in a test and can be referenced.
